# Welcome to AI Step-by-Step
Getting started with AI is surpisingly simple and can begin completely free. These lab guides provide hands-on learning paths for those who want to build their own AI environments from the ground up, whith options that scale affordably: start with completely free tools and resources, progress to intermediate setups, or advance to professiona-grade environments that you can directly apply to real world use cases as your skills and needs grow.

These labs are community-driven and constantly evolving. Spot an improvement or catch an error? We'd love your contribution via Pull Request, or just reach out to the repository contributors.

## Community hardware builds
Need ideas for what your home lab could look like? Want to confirm compatible parts? Here are labs of our Community members.
- [Buu Lam](builds/buu_lam.md)

## Raspberri Pi case
Are you running a lab that uses a Raspberry Pi 5 and it needs a home?

Check out this design for a case: [pi-case](/pi-case/README.md)

## Additional learning resources
- F5's solutions offer tremendous value once you have learned how to build AI. Here are some labs that introduce those solutions. [Secure deliver optimize GenAI](https://github.com/f5devcentral/secure-deliver-optimize-genai)

- Here are some [more labs](morelabs.md) we've come across. PR's are welcome!
