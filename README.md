# Welcome to AI Step-by-Step
Getting started with AI is simple and can be free. The following lab guides act as a starting point for people who want to build their own environment rather than jumping straight into a chat prompt. There will be lab options that are free, then up to ~$1000, then up to a few thousand dollars.

These are Community contributed labs. If you see any opportunities for improvement or errors, please contribute with a Pull Request or notify the Lab Author.

## Community hardware builds
Need ideas for what your home lab could look like? Want to confirm compatible parts? Here are labs of our Community members.
- [Buu Lam](builds/buu_lam.md)

## Raspberri Pi case
Are you running a lab that uses a Raspberry Pi 5 and it needs a home?

Check out this design for a case: [pi-case](/pi-case/README.md)

## Additional learning resources
- F5's solutions offer tremendous value once you have learned how to build AI. Here are some labs that introduce those solutions. [Secure deliver optimize GenAI](https://github.com/f5devcentral/secure-deliver-optimize-genai)

- Here are some [more labs](morelabs.md) we've come across. PR's are welcome!
